# SQL-Employee-Tracker
Building a Content Management System from scratch.

## Description
> In this project, I used nodejs and mySQL to create a database accessible through the CLI in which you could view employees, roles, and departments.  In addition you are able to add roles, add departments, add employees, and update employees quickly and easily.
